# TypeGo

For this game, the setting happens to take place in space where the protagonist (you) wanders
through it trying to avoid floating letters or words that if not typed in time will crash into you
and make you lose. You are put into a spaceship which helps you maneuver through the dangerous
setting of words being thrown at you. In order to survive, you will have to shoot lasers at them by
typing as fast you can. Once the words are typed correctly, they will be destroyed, and you will be
able to move on to the following levels. If not, you will fail and the words will crash into you,
thus making you lose the game and having to make you restart. In this game, there will be 5 levels,
each having different difficulties associated with them and making it progressively harder for the
player. The main source of inspiration comes from the game “Typing Attack “.
